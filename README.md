# BadYGOHandSimulator
C program that simulates a Yu-Gi-Oh first turn hand with two custom pre made decks.

# Known Bugs: 
1. Giving an input that is not an integer WILL loop input.
2. Some cards on the hand don't even have a name!! Like its EMPTY!

# Planned Features:
1. Read Deck from a .txt file to populate deck array variable instead of custom mades cuz these decks aren't even good so like why simulate a deck you don't know and like!
2. Idk this is just a practice thing anyway so like does it matter
